# Expense_Tracker_Backend

This is my 3rd year project. It is the backend of a Expense Tracker Application build using Java Springboot.
It involves creating API's for operations like - create, read, update, delete for Expense, Income.
It has a dynamic dashboard which gives summarized details for monthly expenses and incomes with a graph representing money debited v/s credited.
It uses a mysql database to store the data from the application.

## Following are the snapshots of the application
